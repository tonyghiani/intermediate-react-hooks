/**
 * This exercise is made to firstly learn the benefits of the built-in useReducer hook.
 *
 * With useReducer, we can defined define a logic to pass to our hook.
 * This is usually associated with the reducer pattern,
 * in which we dispatch actions with a type and a payload,
 * reducing them depending on the needs.
 *
 * There is much more we can do with it.
 *
 * Let's try now to create a useToggle hook,
 * which returns an array containing a boolean value,
 * and a function to switch the value to the opposite.
